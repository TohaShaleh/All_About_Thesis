First of all, all praise to the creator, I successfully completed writing my thesis.
I received a lot of help and advice from a certain number of people to whom I
will be grateful for the rest of my life. Without their support, I could not have
finished my thesis. Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation
to my supervisor, Md.Obaidur Rahman, Associate Professor, Department of CSE, CUET, for
all of his assistance and support throughout my thesis. From the very beginning,
he guided me on how to progress with my thesis work. He listened and tried
to solve all the problems I faced, even if they were the slightest. It helped me
to overcome all of the difficulties I faced during my thesis work which I could have never done otherwise. My gratitude also leads to the defense members of the committee for their constructive criticism, suggestions for improvement, and
approval of my efforts. I would also like to thank my wife and my sisters for supporting and
encouraging me throughout this entire period.
