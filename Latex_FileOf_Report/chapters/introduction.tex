\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The accurate and efficient segmentation of water bodies in very high-resolution satellite and aerial images is critical for various applications in remote sensing, including environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management.\cite{intro1} Remote sensing technologies provide valuable tools for acquiring detailed spatial information over large areas, enabling precise analysis and decision-making. However, the complex nature of high-resolution imagery poses significant challenges for traditional image processing techniques, necessitating the adoption of advanced machine learning models for accurate and automated segmentation tasks.\cite{intro2}\cite{res1}

In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm in image analysis, offering state-of-the-art solutions for semantic segmentation tasks\cite{res2}. Among the deep learning models, DeepLabv3+ has shown exceptional performance in segmenting objects with fine details and boundaries. This thesis focuses on enhancing the segmentation accuracy of water bodies by leveraging the DeepLabv3+ model and introducing a novel ensemble technique.

The primary objective of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of an ensemble approach using ResNet50V2, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNetV2 as backbones in the DeepLabv3+ architecture. By employing a weighted averaging ensemble method, we aim to capitalize on the unique strengths of each backbone: ResNet50V2 for its robust feature extraction capabilities, MobileNetV3 for its computational efficiency, and EfficientNetV2 for its superior scaling properties. This ensemble strategy is expected to improve the model's ability to capture intricate details and variations in water region imagery, leading to enhanced segmentation accuracy and robustness.
Accurate and timely identification of water bodies is a critical component of management. Traditional methods for water mapping, such as ground surveys and hydrological modeling, are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and limited in spatial coverage\cite{res3}. Remote sensing technology, which involves acquiring and analyzing satellite or aerial imagery, has emerged as a powerful tool and mapping due to its ability to provide large-scale and real-time data\cite{res4}.
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence \cite{intro3}, particularly deep learning, have further enhanced the potential of remote sensing for water bodies segmentation. Deep learning models, with their ability to automatically learn and extract complex features from raw data, have shown great promise in various image analysis tasks. Among these models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been particularly successful in the field of image segmentation.

This thesis focuses on the application of DeepLabV3+, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, for water bodies segmentation from remote sensing imagery. DeepLabV3+ is a semantic segmentation model that utilizes atrous convolution and spatial pyramid pooling to capture multi-scale contextual information. The model employs ResNet-50 as its encoder for feature extraction, significantly enhancing its ability to produce accurate segmentation maps.\cite{intro4}

The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a robust segmentation model that can accurately delineate water affected areas from satellite images. A comprehensive dataset comprising multi-spectral satellite images and corresponding ground truth annotations was used to train and validate the model. The performance of DeepLabV3+ was assessed using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), precision, recall, and F1 score.

The results of this study demonstrate that DeepLabV3+ achieves high accuracy in water bodies segmentation, outperforming traditional image processing techniques and other segmentation models. By leveraging advanced deep learning methodologies, this research contributes to the development of more effective flood response strategies and disaster management practices. Future work may involve integrating additional data sources, such as topographic and meteorological data, to further enhance model accuracy and predictive capabilities.

The model selection phase focuses on choosing DeepLabV3+ as the semantic segmentation model, utilizing pre-trained ResNet50V2, EfficientNetV2, MobileNetV3 backbone to leverage transfer learning.
