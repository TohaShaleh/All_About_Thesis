# All_About_Thesis
My thesis topic was " Ensemble of deep learning models for water areas segmentation from remote sensing imegery "
Here i have trained a few models seperately on same dataset to see their individual performance. 
Then i used weighted averaging ensemble method after training all these models which are MobileNetV3 , EfficientNetV2 , ResNet50V2 .
Then i noticed that it gives me more accuracy and mean Intersection over Union (mean IoU) rather than a single model . 
Then i have implement a weighted averaging ensemble model along with different curves such as Precision,recall,Loss,Accuracy and mean IoU.
